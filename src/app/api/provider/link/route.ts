// POST /api/provider/link  -> attach a network address to an existing, already-claimed listing.
//
// Two distinct operations share this route, with DIFFERENT authorization:
//
//   LINK a NEW network onto the listing (the address is not yet on it): requires proof of BOTH
//     identities - an owner SESSION that belongs to the listing (proof you own it), AND a signature
//     from the new address B (proof you control what you are adding). Without the owner-session gate,
//     anyone controlling a registered entity on the added network could attach it to a rival's
//     listing by name (listing contamination). The owner session is the cookie the provider already
//     holds from claiming/managing the listing, so no live wallet switch is needed.
//
//   VERIFY an EXISTING row already on the listing (re-proving an address that is already attached):
//     needs only B's signature, since the address is already part of the listing - no owner session
//     required. This path cannot attach anything new.
//
// Shared gates for both: the listing is matched BY NAME and must already have a verified owner; for
// mainnet, B must be an on-chain registered FTSO entity on B's chain; B must not already be a
// verified part of a DIFFERENT claimed listing.
